## <p class="text-center">[LINK TO NOFO](IllinoisHEALSDemoNOFO.pdf)

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting a proposal for one Illinois HEALS Demonstration site grant. Grants will be made with VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT FFY 17 funds. A total of $ 800,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 12 months. 

**Application deadline: July 8,2019.**

In 2017, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority was awarded a Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth Demonstration grant from the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [1]. The demonstration project seeks to address the needs of child and youth victims [2] and their families [3] by identifying young crime victims, coordinating prevention and intervention services post-victimization, and building capacity within communities to provide needed services and support. 

The overarching vision for Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems) is to alleviate the burden of finding services to address victimization by ensuring appropriate care and services are made available to all victims regardless of the door they first enter, whether it is a doctor’s office, school, or local police station or sheriff’s office.

  1. Illinois is one of four states designated as a demonstration site. 
  2. We acknowledge that the term victim does not resonate with everyone who has experienced violence. Some prefer the term survivor or person impacted by violence. We encourage people and communities to use terms that best reflect their experiences. 
Throughout this document we use the terms children and youth and young persons to refer to individuals from birth to 25 years of age.
  3. For reading ease, throughout this document we use the term family or family members to refer to the adults and other individuals who may live with and/or provide primary care for children and youth. These individuals or adults may include biological relatives (e.g., siblings, adults/uncles, grandparents, parents) and other caregivers (e.g., foster families, other non-relative adults).
