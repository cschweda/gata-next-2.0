        </h2>
        <p>The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals for grants the federal Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Program (RSAT). Grants will be made with FY18 RSAT funds. A total of $700,000 in funding shall be made available to local government agencies for corrections-based or jail-based substance use disorder treatment or aftercare programs that meet the criteria detailed in the notice of funding opportunity for use over a period of 12 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Application deadline: October 31, 2019</strong></p>
        <h2 id="program-requirements">Program Requirements</h2>
        <p>This grant will fund programs in the following categories which are defined below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Strive to integrate the Illinois HEALS Mission, Values, and Principles as outlined in the purpose area of this solicitation.</li>
            <li>Jail-based substance use disorder treatment</li>
            <li>Aftercare services</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="corrections-based-substance-use-disorder-treatment">Corrections-based substance use disorder treatment</h3>
        <p>Programs must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engage participants for a period between six and 12 months.</li>
            <li>Provide residential treatment facilities set apart from the general correctional population. This can be a completely separate facility or dedicated housing unit in a facility exclusively for RSAT participants.</li>
            <li>Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.</li>
            <li>Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve the substance use and related problems.</li>
            <li>Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing for program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and for former participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.</li>
            <li>Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that support the use of medication-assisted treatment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If possible, RSAT participation should be limited to inmates with six to 12 months remaining in their confinement so they can be released from prison instead of returning to the general prison population after completing the program.
            Program design must be based on effective, scientific practices.</p>
        <h3 id="jail-based-substance-use-disorder-treatment">Jail-based substance use disorder treatment</h3>
        <p>Programs must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engage participants for at least three months.</li>
            <li>Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.</li>
            <li>Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve the substance use and related problems with emphasis on the provision of cognitive-behavioral therapy.</li>
            <li>Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing for program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and for former participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.</li>
            <li>Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that support the use of medication assisted treatment.</li>
            <li>If possible, jail-based programs should separate the treatment population from the general correctional population and program design should be based on effective, scientific practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="aftercare-services">Aftercare Services</h3>
        <p>Substance use disorder treatment, established or implemented with assistance provided under RSAT, must provide aftercare services.</p>
        <p>Programs must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Involve coordination between the correctional treatment program, post-release supervision officer, and other social service and rehabilitation programs and services.</li>
            <li>Work in conjunction with state and local authorities and organizations involved in substance use disorder treatment to assist in the placement of program participants into community substance use disorder treatment programs or services on release.</li>
            <li>Provide reentering individuals with comprehensive care coordination prior to and upon release from the facility. This includes a comprehensive reentry plan for aftercare services, other needs, and resources. It is most successfully accomplished when institution staff initiates linkages with aftercare agencies and services outside of the institution, including social services and/or treatment services, parole, and case management [1]. Continuity between prison and community can reduce re-offense rates [2].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To qualify as an aftercare program, the head of the substance use disorder treatment program must work in conjunction with state and local authorities and organizations involved in substance use disorder treatment to assist in the placement of program participants into community substance use disorder treatment programs or services on release.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Effective correctional and aftercare programming is most effective if they are <strong><em>structured, cognitive-behavioral, and skills-based.</em></strong> Approaches such as Alcoholics Anonymous or faith/spiritual-based services do not meet the standard for correctional or treatment programs [3].</p>
