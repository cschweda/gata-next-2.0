## Program Design

The program design consists of an assessment and planning period to be completed by June 30, 2019. Developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network’s Treatment and Services Adaptation Center for Resilience, Hope, and Wellness in Schools and the Center for School Mental Health, the Trauma Responsive Schools Implementation Assessment (TRS-IA) provides a comprehensive assessment that can also be used by schools to document immediate and long-term changes. Grantees will assist schools in completing the assessment and developing an action plan with immediate and longer-term projects. Grantees may select to include additional tools in their assessment process. The action plan is due July 15, 2019 and must be approved by ICJIA by August 1, 2019.  Contingent on satisfactory performance, future appropriation, and approval of the action plan, grantees may receive continuation funding for implementation of the action plan resulting from this notice.
