A total of $ 800,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 12 months.\n\n**Application deadline: July 8,2019.**\n\nIn 2017, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority was awarded a Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth Demonstration grant from the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [1].

Illinois is one of four states designated as a demonstration site.\n2. We acknowledge that the term victim does not resonate with everyone who has experienced violence.

For reading ease, throughout this document we use the term family or family members to refer to the adults and other individuals who may live with and/or provide primary care for children and youth.
